# Big-Words
Simple Java program that shows your keyboard input in big white letters on a full black screen

## Controls
* Enter to clear the screen
* Backspace to clear last letter

Note: "W" cannot be used because of strange
letter wrapping when displayed in large font.
Please let me know if there is a fix to this!
See comment in code in the keyboard listener
